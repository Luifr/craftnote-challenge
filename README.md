# Craftnote challenge

This project the craftnote technical challenge

## Technical info

### Api

This rest api is provided by [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and protected by [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) and [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors).
After the project starts, it lists all endpoints with [express-list-endpoints](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-list-endpoints)

### File structure (src)

- routes (contain the api routes and resolvers)
  - <service> (a folder for each business necessity, like direction)
    - Routes
    - Tests (the test file(s) is with each route so that it can test all kinds of validations by calling that rest endpoint)
- <service> (a folder for each business necessity, like direction)
  - Controllers (request resolvers)
  - Validations

### Development

While developing run `npm run dev` instead of `npm run start`. In that way the project with restart whenever a .ts file changes because of [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)

### Git hooks (Husky)

- Before any commit husky runs tsc (transpiler), lint (Eslint)
- Before any push husky runs tsc (transpiler), lint (Eslint) and tests (Jest & Supertest)
  - Tests are made only in pre-push because of the time to run all the tests when the project gets bigger

### Test (Jest & Supertest)

Run `npm run test`

[Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) is used to help us test our code and [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) mocks http requests

### Lint (Eslint)

Run `npm run lint`

### Formatter (prettier)

1. To get the benefit of auto formatting in vscode install prettier globally `npm i -g prettier` and the [prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

## Setup & Running

### How to setup locally

Requirements: node, npm

1. run `npm i` to install all dependecies
1. run `npm start` and the project will start running in port 3000 (configurable in package.json)

### How to run locally

1. Send a get request in `localhost:3000/direction` with two url parameters `heading` and `target` both are rational numbers between 0 and 359
1. Receive the response with an object giving the direction `{ direction: string }`, direction can be left, right or straight
1. If there is any problem in the validation the response will be like this `{ error: string }`

### How to run with Docker

Simply run `npm run docker:init` or the following steps (it will bind local port 3000 to the container port 3000, it is configurable in the package.json)

1. `docker build . -t <image-name>`
1. `docker run -p <any-free-port>:3000 -d <image-name>`
